          是2022年由國立清華大學黃芸茵老師團隊創辦的專業教育服務，專為國小學童提供客製化的英語口說練習內容。此服務最初在新竹市建功國小推行，現已在新竹市政府與國立清華大學USR-Hub的支持下，擴展至新竹市其他國小。

          透過這項計畫，我們親自走訪校園，與學生互動並進行錄音，將這些內容上傳至podcast平台。透過podcast的錄製，孩子們不僅能練習英語，還能討論並分享自己喜愛的人事物，這也成為他們與家人朋友分享樂趣並延續學習體驗的絕佳管道。

          Is a professional educational service founded in 2022 by Professor Huang Yun-Yin's team at National Tsing Hua University, specifically designed to provide customized English speaking practice content for elementary school students. Initially implemented at Jian Gong Elementary School in Hsinchu City, this service has since expanded to other elementary schools in Hsinchu City with the support of the Hsinchu City Government and National Tsing Hua University's USR-Hub.

          Through this program, we personally visit schools, interact with students, and conduct recordings, which are then uploaded to podcast platforms. By participating in these podcasts, children not only practice their English but also discuss and share their favorite topics.

      在小學階段，CLIL（Content and Language Integrated Learning，學科內容與語言整合學習法）是一種適合且有效的語言教育方法。然而，要進一步強化學習效果，還需從內外部因素著手。由於英語在台灣的社會中並非主要的溝通語言，大多數學生僅能在課堂上接觸英語。教師可以利用成績和獎勵等外部因素來激發學生的學習興趣，然而這些外在動機難以持久。如果學生無法在課堂外找到使用英語的真實目的及意義，他們可能會失去長期學習的動力。因此，在外語教育中，為學生提供一個與日常生活相關且具真實需求的學習環境至關重要。

      At the elementary school level, Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is a suitable and effective approach to language education. However, to further enhance learning outcomes, both internal and external factors must be considered. Since English is not a primary language of communication in Taiwan, most students are only exposed to English in the classroom. Teachers can use grades and rewards as external motivators to spark students’ interest in learning, but these external motivations often lack longevity. If students are unable to find real-life purposes and meaning for using English outside the classroom, they may lose the motivation to continue learning in the long term. Therefore, it is crucial in foreign language education to provide students with a learning environment that is relevant to their daily lives and meets real needs.

    童心。同享 We Care We Share正是為了解決這一問題而設計的。透過與學生的互動與錄製，讓他們能夠在真實情境中使用英語，不僅增進英語口說能力，還使學習過程變得更具意義和趣味性。台灣的小學生目前主要學習基本的英語詞彙和語法，但鮮少有機會在課堂外的自然情境中使用這些知識。因此，創造一個舒適、自在、並提供足夠資源與支持的學習環境，讓學生能自信地在課內外使用英語，是雙語教育成功的關鍵。當學生感受到學習語言的真實目的時，他們會更有動力積極參與學習，進而提升學習成效並增進英語能力。

    童心。同享 We Care We Share was designed to address this issue. Through interactions and recordings with students, they are given the opportunity to use English in authentic situations, which not only improves their speaking skills but also makes the learning process more meaningful and enjoyable. Currently, elementary school students in Taiwan primarily learn basic English vocabulary and grammar, but they rarely have opportunities to apply this knowledge in natural settings outside the classroom. Thus, creating a comfortable, supportive learning environment with sufficient resources where students feel confident using English both inside and outside the classroom is key to the success of bilingual education. When students perceive a real purpose for learning a language, they become more motivated to actively engage in their studies, ultimately enhancing their learning outcomes and improving their English proficiency.
